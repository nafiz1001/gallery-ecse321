## Project Overview
With the pandemic forcing businesses to move to a remote setting, we are developing a website and Android app to allow the art gallery in our neighborhood to promote and sell the art of local artists. Clients will be able to search through an assortment of art published by various artists on the platform. In addition, the client is able to purchase the art pieces that they desire using different payment methods. Software development, requirements engineering, validation of the system and automation of the software delivery process were all utilised by a team of 5 to implement the system.
